## 📝 Description
This project investigates the **impact of short-term rental regulations on Airbnb markets** using data analytics and visualization.  
It aims to uncover how different types of regulations influence key market indicators such as:  

- Number of active listings  
- Average nightly prices  
- Revenue distribution across hosts  
- Market concentration (professional vs. casual hosts)  

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook using **Python**, leveraging real-world Airbnb datasets.  
Findings from this project can help **policymakers, hosts, and researchers** better understand the economic and social effects of Airbnb regulations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess how short-term rental regulations affect Airbnb market dynamics.  
- Compare pre- and post-regulation trends in **listings, pricing, and revenues**.  
- Distinguish between effects on **professional vs. casual hosts**.  
- Provide **policy-relevant insights** for cities regulating short-term rentals.  

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Regulations often lead to a **decline in active listings**, but prices tend to rise.  
- Professional hosts are more **resilient to regulatory changes** compared to casual hosts.  
- Revenue distribution becomes more concentrated among fewer hosts.  
- Market recovery speed varies by **city and type of regulation**.

## 🚀 Recommendations
- Focus on premium central areas while maintaining offerings in budget-friendly neighborhoods.
- Implement dynamic pricing to balance supply-demand fluctuations.
- Diversify listings, especially targeting medium-capacity stays (3–6 guests).
- Strengthen customer experience with quality listings and repeat-stay strategies.
- Stay compliant and adapt to evolving local regulations for long-term sustainability.
